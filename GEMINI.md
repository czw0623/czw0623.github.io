# Project Overview

This is a simple, static website hosted on GitHub Pages. It consists of two main pages:

*   `index.html`: A placeholder main page.
*   `marvelChampions/mg.html`: A detailed, interactive campaign log for the "Mutant Genesis" campaign of the Marvel Champions card game. This page uses JavaScript and local storage to allow users to save and load their campaign progress directly in the browser.

The project does not have any server-side components or complex build processes.

# Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the project, simply open the `.html` files in a web browser.

*   **Main Page**: Open `index.html` in your browser.
*   **Marvel Champions Campaign Log**: Open `marvelChampions/mg.html` in your browser.

# Development Conventions

There are no formal development conventions established for this project. The code is simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
